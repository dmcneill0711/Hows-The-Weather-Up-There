# Web-Design-Challenge

*This is an extension of the Python-API-Challenge:

*The images used in this challenge were created by running the program in the WeatherPy.ipynb, and saving the outputs in the Images folder, located in Assets.

*The CSV used was also created by the WeatherPy.ipynb, exported, and saved in the Resources folder to be used as the CSV to create the table for the Data page.

This will create a website that has individual pages dedicated to providing small analyses each of the affects of latitude on 4 different weather conditions:

1) Temperature
2) Humidity
3) Wind Speed
4) Cloud Coverage

There are also 2 additional pages:

1) Comparisons: which includes all of previous graphs and an overall analysis of findings.
2) Data: which is a table based off of the cities CSV provided.

Also Included:

1) CSS stylings page
2) HTLM code that builds the table
3) Jupyter Notebook that converts the CSV into HTML
